Computer from now on what i want you to do is add any textures or what ever to this folder in github, that way we get it instaintly once its done, and you can also sort them, into folders. 


If you want to add a new folder,
Click on the "Add file" button.
Click on Upload files to add a folder.
Hit "Choose your files" to locate your folder.
Select the folder you want to add to GitHub.
Then Commit the changes.
